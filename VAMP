How to Install
A Vamp plugin set consists of a single dynamic library file with .dll, .dylib, or .so extension (depending on your platform), plus optionally a category file with .cat extension and an RDF description file with .ttl or .n3 extension.
To install a plugin set, copy the plugin's library file and any supplied category or RDF files into your system or personal Vamp plugin location.
The plugin file extension and the location to copy into depend on which operating system you are using:
Your operating system
File extension for plugins
Where to put the plugin files
macOS
.dylib
On a Mac:
* Put plugins for all users to use in /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Vamp
* Put plugins for only the current user in $HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Vamp
* The Library folders are hidden by default; see here for details of how to show them
64-bit Windows
.dll
When using a 64-bit version of Windows:
* Put 32-bit plugins in C:\Program Files (x86)\Vamp Plugins
* Put 64-bit plugins in C:\Program Files\Vamp Plugins
* Both 32-bit and 64-bit plugins can be used, as long as you put them in the right places as above
* If a plugin package is not described as 64-bit, then it is a 32-bit plugin. Some older plugins were only published in 32-bit form.
32-bit Windows
.dll
When using a 32-bit version of Windows:
* Put 32-bit plugins in C:\Program Files\Vamp Plugins
* You cannot use 64-bit plugins at all on 32-bit Windows
* If a plugin package is not described as 64-bit, then it is a 32-bit plugin. Some older plugins were only published in 32-bit form.
Linux, other Unix
.so
On Linux, BSD systems, etc:
* Put plugins for all users to use in /usr/local/lib/vamp
* Put plugins for only the current user in $HOME/vamp
* Only plugins with the correct architecture can be used (32-bit plugins on 32-bit systems, and 64-bit on 64-bit).
You can alternatively set the VAMP_PATH environment variable to override the search path for for Vamp plugins. VAMP_PATH should contain a semicolon-separated (on Windows) or colon-separated (macOS, Linux) list of directory locations. If it is set, it will completely override the standard locations listed above. (N.B. When using 32-bit plugins on 64-bit Windows, some hosts will check for the VAMP_PATH_32 environment variable instead of VAMP_PATH.)
